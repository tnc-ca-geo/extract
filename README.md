# extract

Simple Python tool to extract images from videos

## Instruction for use under Windows

### Install Python 2.7

We are using Python 2.7 because of its ubiquity and possible compatibility issues in some of the used modules.

Get it for Windows https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install.

Make sure it is on your path:

Go to start menu > type ```cmd``` into search field > open cmd

Type ```which python``` on the command line. It should return the path of the python executable, something like ```/c/Python27/python```

### Test whether pip is available

Pip is Python's package manager. Since Python 2.7.9 it ships with the install and should be readily available.

Try: ```pip --help```

If that fails, you might
1. Update your Python installation
2. Get pip separately, see here https://www.python.org/downloads/
