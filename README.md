### Install Python 2.7

We are using Python 2.7 because of its ubiquity and possible compatibility issues in some of the used modules.

Get it for Windows https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install.

Make sure it is on your path:

Go to start menu > type ```cmd``` into search field > open cmd

Type ```which python``` on the command line. It should return the path of the python executable, something like ```/c/Python27/python```
